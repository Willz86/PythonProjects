# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have developed as part of my journey to enhance my programming skills and to showcase my capabilities in software development.

## About This Repository

Each project in this repository is part of my ongoing effort to refine my Python programming skills and to demonstrate practical applications of these skills in solving problems or implementing interesting features.

The projects you'll find here range from simple scripts to more complex applications, each aimed at tackling different kinds of challenges. Through these projects, I aim to present a versatile portfolio that reflects my ability to handle a variety of programming tasks.

## Portfolio Goals

- **Skill Enhancement:** Each project is an opportunity to improve specific programming skills, from data handling to creating user interfaces.
- **Problem Solving:** Demonstrating the ability to approach problems methodically and implement effective solutions.
- **Showcasing Creativity:** Utilizing Python to build projects that are not only functional but also innovative and engaging.

## Projects Overview

- **CTF Word Scrapper:** Run the script in your Python environment. It will prompt you for a website URL, scrape the site, and save the wordlist to a file named wordlist.txt in the same directory as the script

- **Hash Reader:** Creating a Python script that identifies hash types and provides corresponding hashcat and John the Ripper commands is a practical tool for security testing and password recovery scenarios. This script will use a series of checks to determine the likely hash type based on the format and length of the hash string provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request, or open an issue with your comments.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you find the projects interesting and useful!
